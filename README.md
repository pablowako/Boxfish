# Boxfish

This project was developed on Angular 12.2 as a technical skill test for a potential employer, [Boxfish Studio](https://boxfish.studio/).

## Requirements

I was tasked with copying a landing page provided to me via Figma, with embedded images and specified colors. It had to look as close as possible to the original, had to have a dark mode (design provided in the same Figma file) with a toggle button, had to have responsive design and had to show the following on the console: 

- The user's IP address
- The user's geolocation
- The user's device and browser
- Time since the site was opened, updating every second 
- Position of the mouse on the page, shown only once every second 

The site had to be a web-app, preferably created using a framework, and had to be hosted on GitHub.

I had an initial time limit of 7 days which could be expanded if necessary.
